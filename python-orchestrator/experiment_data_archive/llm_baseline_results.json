The time it takes to fall to the ground can be estimated using the vertical motion equation. However, since I am already falling, the remaining time to impact is difficult to calculate precisely without knowing the exact height of the platforms. I can't influence my trajectory now.",
        "Since I am already falling (vy = -8.17 m/s) and not grounded, jumping now will not change my trajectory significantly. My horizontal velocity is vx = 0.92 m/s. The gap starts at x=2.00m and I am currently at x=3.33m. The goal center is at x=7.30+9.70/2=8.5m. I am already past the start of the gap. I need to land and then move forward and jump. Since I am in the air, the only thing I can do is idle.",
        "My current horizontal velocity is 0.75 m/s. The gap starts at x=2.00m and the goal starts at x=7.30m. I am currently at x=3.47m. I am falling, so jumping now would not help. I need to get closer to the edge of the platform before jumping."
