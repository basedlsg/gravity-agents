# System ID: Actuation Calibration Data (Jump Impulse)

This dataset correlates 'Jump Step' (Impulse Duration) with 'Landed Distance' (Output).
It demonstrates the linearity of the physics engine for high-force actions.

## Calibration Table
| Jump Step (Impulse) | Average Distance (m) | Success Rate |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | 7.9304m | 0% |
| 4 | 5.5315m | 0% |
| 5 | 6.0518m | 0% |
| 6 | 9.3455m | 100% |
| 7 | 6.6710m | 0% |
| 8 | 6.8077m | 0% |
